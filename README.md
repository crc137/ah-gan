- Messages containing obscene language are deleted based on the censure settings
- **Code Messages:** 
  - Can be ignored globally based on settings
  - Can be allowed only in specific topics when code access is enabled
  - Support for multiple topics with individual access control
  - Each topic can be enabled/disabled independently
  - Blocked in all other topics when topic-specific access is configured
- **Link Filtering:**
  - **Whitelist-only Mode:** Only links from whitelist are allowed
  - **Automatic Blocking:** Non-whitelisted links are automatically blocked
  - **Detailed Reporting:** Shows which specific links were blocked
