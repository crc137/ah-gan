## System Behavior

### Warning System
- When a user violates chat rules (using banned words, posting links when not allowed, etc.), they receive a warning
- After 5 warnings, the user is automatically banned from the chat
- Only administrators can remove warnings using the inline buttons on warning messages

### Content Filtering
- Messages containing banned words or emojis are automatically deleted
- Messages in languages other than those allowed (Russian and English by default) are deleted
- Messages containing obscene language are deleted based on the censure settings
- Messages containing code snippets (PHP, Python, JavaScript, etc.) can be ignored based on settings
- Links are blocked unless they match patterns in the whitelist

### Admin Privileges
- Administrators are exempt from content filtering and warning systems
- Only administrators can change chat settings and manage banned content
- Administrators receive reports submitted by users

## Notes
- Each chat has its own independent settings for banned content, censure settings, and general settings
- Settings are persistent and will be maintained even if the bot is restarted
- Some features may require the bot to have appropriate permissions in the chat (delete messages, ban users, etc.)
